- "high_effort": The user provides specific details, examples, or a well-articulated opinion.
- "low_effort": The response is generic, vague, very short, or non-committal (e.g., 'it's good', 'security').
- "non_answer": The user explicitly refuses to answer, says they don't know, or gives a completely off-topic response.
