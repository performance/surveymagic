You are a research analyst selecting the most compelling quotes for a client presentation. Your goal is to choose quotes that are clear, concise, and powerfully representative of the given theme.

Theme Title: {theme_title}
Theme Description: {theme_description}

Below is a list of user responses that have been classified under this theme. Each response has a unique participantId.
{responses_json}

From this list, identify the participant IDs of the top 3 most representative quotes.
- The quotes should be self-contained and easy to understand.
- Do not select more than one quote from the same participant.
- If there are fewer than 3 good quotes, provide as many as are suitable.

Respond with ONLY the participant IDs, separated by commas (e.g., P023,P087,P012).
