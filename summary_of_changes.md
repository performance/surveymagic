# Summary of Session Work

This session focused on improving the robustness, maintainability, and efficiency of the qualitative data analysis pipeline.

## Key Improvements and Fixes:

1.  **Code Refactoring & Maintainability:**
    *   **Centralized Caching:** The duplicated caching logic was refactored from `src/main.py` into a new, reusable caching module at `src/llm_utils/caching.py`. This makes the caching mechanism more robust and easier to maintain.
    *   **Simplified Parallelism:** The parallel execution in `src/main.py` was simplified by switching from `ThreadPoolExecutor.submit` and `as_completed` to the more direct `executor.map`, making the code cleaner and easier to understand.

2.  **Performance Enhancement:**
    *   **Enabled Parallel Processing:** The main analysis loop in `src/main.py` was parallelized using `ThreadPoolExecutor`. This significantly speeds up the data processing by analyzing each question concurrently.

3.  **Bug Fixes:**
    *   **`NameError` in Quote Selection:** Fixed a `NameError` in `src/analysis/quote_selector.py` caused by an incorrect variable name (`responses` instead of `classified_responses`).
    *   **Threading Scope Issues:** Resolved `NameError` and `UnboundLocalError` exceptions that occurred during parallel execution. The root cause was that the `json` module was not imported within the scope of the worker threads. This was fixed by adding `import json` directly inside the functions that were being executed in parallel (`select_quotes_for_theme`, `generate_question_narrative`, `map_questions_to_objectives`).
    *   **JSON Decoding Errors:** Investigated and addressed `json.JSONDecodeError` warnings. The LLM was not consistently returning valid JSON. The prompt at `prompts/generate_headline_summary.txt` was updated to be more stringent, instructing the LLM to return *only* a JSON object.

## Next Steps:

*   Verify that the prompt changes have eliminated the JSON decoding warnings.
*   Consider adding a comprehensive test suite to ensure long-term maintainability.
