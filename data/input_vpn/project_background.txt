The primary goal of this research study is to understand the consumer privacy market, 
specifically in the areas of network privacy (VPNs) and data deletion services. 
We aim to size the market, identify key customer needs and use cases, 
and validate product-market fit for CLIENT’s offerings in these spaces. 
The insights from this study will inform CLIENT’s go-to-market strategy and 
product roadmap to best address the needs of the target market.
