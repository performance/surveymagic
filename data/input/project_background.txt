Project Brief
Project Title: "The Digital Classroom": Understanding User Experience and Value Drivers in Online Learning
Background: The online learning market has matured rapidly, moving from a niche alternative to a primary mode of education for millions worldwide. With this growth comes intense competition and evolving user expectations. Our platform, "LearnSphere," needs to move beyond simply offering courses and focus on delivering a superior, engaging, and effective learning experience to increase user retention, completion rates, and market share.
Primary Goal: This research study aims to conduct a deep dive into the behaviors, motivations, and perceptions of online learners. The insights gathered will directly inform LearnSphere's product development roadmap, marketing messaging, and pricing strategies to better meet the needs of our target user segments.
Target Audience for Survey: A diverse group of 100+ individuals across North America and Europe who have used at least one online learning platform (e.g., Coursera, Udemy, Skillshare, EdX, LinkedIn Learning, or university-specific platforms) in the past 12 months. The audience will include:
University/College Students
Working Professionals seeking career advancement
Career Changers learning new skills
Hobbyists and lifelong learners
Key Research Areas:
Motivations & Goals: What triggers the decision to take an online course?
Platform Selection: What criteria are used to choose one platform over another?
Engagement & Experience: Which platform features and course elements are most (and least) effective for learning?
Perceived Outcomes: Do users feel they achieve their goals and get a return on their investment (of time and money)?
Pricing & Value Perception: How do users perceive the value of different pricing models (subscription vs. per-course)?
