Objective 1: Identify Key User Personas and Their Learning Journeys.
Description: To segment the online learner market into distinct personas (e.g., "The Career Climber," "The University Supplementer," "The Passion Pursuer") based on their motivations, goals, and platform usage patterns.
Application in Decision-Making: This will allow the marketing team to create highly targeted campaigns and enable the product team to tailor the user onboarding experience to better align with the specific goals of each persona.
Objective 2: Determine the Critical Drivers of Course Engagement and Completion.
Description: To pinpoint the specific features, content formats, and community elements (e.g., interactive quizzes, peer-graded assignments, active forums, instructor accessibility) that have the strongest correlation with user engagement and successful course completion.
Application in Decision-Making: Guide the allocation of engineering and content development resources. Prioritize building and enhancing features that are proven to combat dropout rates and improve learning outcomes.
Objective 3: Benchmark User Satisfaction and Feature Importance Against Competitors.
Description: To assess how LearnSphere's core features (video player, mobile app, course materials, etc.) are perceived in terms of quality and importance relative to key competitors mentioned by users. This includes identifying feature gaps and areas of excellence.
Application in Decision-Making: Inform the strategic product roadmap. This will help decide whether to invest in closing a competitive gap (e.g., building a better mobile experience) or doubling down on an area where we already lead.
Objective 4: Evaluate Perceived ROI and Optimize Pricing Strategy.
Description: To understand whether learners feel their investment (in both time and money) was worthwhile by measuring their ability to apply new skills and their overall satisfaction with outcomes. This objective also directly assesses preferences for subscription vs. per-course payment models and gauges price sensitivity.
Application in Decision-Making: Provide data-driven support for optimizing our pricing and packaging. This will help answer critical questions like "Should we introduce a premium subscription tier?" or "Is our per-course pricing aligned with the value users perceive?"
